# NBA Predictor

NBA Predictor is a project that predicts the win/lose outcome of a game based on numerous input features. 
Users can choose 2 teams and the model will analyze it to provide a prediction.
This project helps me learn how to preprocess structured data and learn the basics of neural networks.

## Skills
- Use Python as main coding language
- Use pandas and matplotlib to analyze data
- Learn how to clean data and check if data is valid
- Learn how to do feature engineering
- Learn how to implement neural networks using PyTorch
